\begin{abstract}
This article will try to characterize how cacheparameters effect the sorting
algorithms \emph{bubblesort} and \emph{quicksort} on a single-cycle
\emph{MIPS-32} architecture.
Furtermore we will adapt the algorithms to handle records of variable size
(length and width) by sorting a list of only the record key and index of this
key, then arraning the record after these indexes.

Our findings are that both bubblesort and quicksort benifit from a large
blocksize, but if the blocksize is larger than twice the record width
(data-elements pr. record) a higher order of associativity is also needed.

The modified bubblesort benefits by a factor of $\sim10$ from the adapted
algorithm, while quicksort performs a bit slower.
