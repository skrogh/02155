\section{Warm up}
\emph{test1.c} and \emph{test2.c} are two programs written to illustrate data
access and cache use. They both sum an array of $2048$ elements filled with ones
twice, with one of the summing runs ofsetted by the size of the cache. This is repeaded six
times. In both cases the result is $19200$.

\emph{test1.c} sums the elements like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
for ( j = 0; j < 5; j++ ) {
	sum += A[ i ];
	sum += A[ i + CACHE_SIZE ];
}
\end{lstlisting}
ensuring that, atleast for a direct-mapped cache each access to the elements in
array $A$ is trashing the cache.

\emph{test2.c} sums first the lower half of the array (from $i=0$ to
$i=TAB_SIZE-CACHE_SIZE-1$) six times, then the upper (from $i=CACHE_SIZE$ to
$i=TAB_SIZE-1$).

\subsection{Initial remarks}
For all tests the instruction cache penalty has been turned off, so that this
does not affect test results.

In both \emph{test1.c} and \emph{test2.c} the \emph{promexit()} and
\emph{clear\_cache()} functions are put right after \emph{int main()}. This
ensures that the initialization of the processor (setting up stack and stuff we
don't have controll over) doesn't affect the profiling.

To test the program we run \emph{test.c} it with a cache size of $128$ words
arranged in blocks of $4$ on $32$ lines.

Running with a directmapped cache we expect the program to cache-trash all over
the place, and thus we expect a rather low hitrate. In the initalization we hit
on $\frac{3}{4}$ and miss on $\frac{1}{4}$ of the writes to $A$ - while during
the main data manipulation loop we miss on all accesses to $A$. Since this is
roughly 12 times as many misses - a hitrate in the area of $8\%$ is expected. 

Running the program, however, we get a hitrate of $84\%$! This requires an
explanation.
\subsubsection{Decompiling} and getting the assembler code, we can examine what
the compiler has done. In listing \ref{lst:test1ass} we have commented relevant
lines in the assembler code and noted which data accesses that are most likley
to be cache hits and misses:
\lstinputlisting[label={lst:test1ass}]{source/asm/test1.s}
It is clear that the ``problem'' is that $i$, $j$ and $sum$ are being read and
written to memory far more often than we access $A$.
Estimating the hitrate from the assembler code we get:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Hits:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Initalization: For each loop, $i$ is accessed once for checking if the
    loop should continue, once to get the address of $A[i]$ and twice (r/w) for
    appending $i$.
    Due to the blocksize of 4, the write to $A[i]$ will be a hit
    $\frac{3}{4}$ of the time.
    \item Main data loop: $i$, $j$ and $sum$ are accessed $6\cdot 8 + 3$ times
    for each loop
  \end{itemize}
  \item Misses:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Initalization: Due to the blocksize of 4, the write to $A[i]$ will be
    a miss $\frac{1}{4}$ of the time.
    \item Main data loop; $A[i]$ and $A[i + cache_size]$ will be misses and are
    accessed $6\cdot 2$ times for each loop.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Hitrate can now be calculated as $\frac{\mbox{total
  hits}}{\mbox{total hits}+\mbox{total misses}}$ where $\mbox{total hits} =
  (4+3/4\cdot2048 + (6\cdot8+3)\cdot(2048-128))$ and $\mbox{total misses} =
  (1/4\cdot2048 + (6\cdot2)\cdot(2048-128))$. This gives a hitrate of $82\%$,
  not far from the actual hitrate.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{A note on \emph{mips.exe}} in the $D-cache$ window of mipset we
can get the actual total hits, misses, hitrate and execution clocks. These are, and
this is not a mistype, \emph{mips.exe} acually gives this data (our guess is
that mips forgot some zeroes, we have added those to the numbers in ``()''):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hit count: $10516$ ($105160$)
  \item Miss count: $20282$ ($20282$)
  \item Hit rate: $0.84$ ($0.84$)
  \item Cycle count: $19205$ ($1920520$, from the data cache statistics)
\end{itemize}
this tells us that the total hitcount form the \emph{D-cache} window is not
reliable and cycle count should be taken from the data cache statistics window.

\subsubsection{Solution} digging arround on \emph{Stack Overflow} it turns out
the keyword \emph{register} tell the compiler to - if possible - store a variable in
registers. This keyword is put in front of $i$, $j$ and $sum$ as this makes it
possible to show the intended impact of different levels of associativity. With
the keyword in place we can now run \emph{test1.c} and \emph{test2.c} and give
meaningfull explanations to why the hitrate is affected as it is.
