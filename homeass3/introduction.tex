\section{Introduction}
In this report we will examine four programs. Two test programs that are designed to highlight specific cache behaviour and two
classic sorting algorithms, bubblesort and quicksort. The execution time of these programs is heavily dependent on cache parameters, 
such as block size, ways of associativity and total size. The programs are compiled for the MIPS architecture and executed on a 
single cycle MIPS-32 processor simulated by MipsIt. We will reason about the expected execution time of the programs as a function of
cache parameters, and compare our predictions to the measured statistics. We will also modify the classic algorithms to handle database
records, consisting of a key-value pair, sorting by the key and keeping the value unchanged. The performance of the modified programs 
will also be tested.
