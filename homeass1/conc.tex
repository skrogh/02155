\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{What is polling?}
Busy-waiting polling is waiting for a bit to be set, reset or first one, then
the other.

\subsection{How does the computer know whether a number is signed or unsigned?}
It does not. That's the beauti of it. It is up the programmer to keep track of
number representation. Some languages makes this easier, by doing some of the
work for the programmer - or warning him, if he might be mixing representations.

\subsection{What is an overflow?}
When an operation is performed on one or more numbers and the result exeeds that
of which is possible to contain within the given representation of the resulting
number an overflow can (in special cases eg. with saturating math this is not
the case) result in an overflow, where the result - so to speak - \emph{loops
back}.
