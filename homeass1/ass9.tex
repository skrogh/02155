\section{Assignment 9}
The code for this assignment can be seen in the listing below.
\lstinputlisting[caption=Code for assignment 9]{source/ass9.s}
This code bears no resemblance to the code from home assignment 1, only the add operation is the same. The program 
reads two numbers entered by a user in the terminal using the getdigit subroutine which places the decimal value
of the entered character in the \$v0 register. The program does not consider other inputs than the numeric characters.
An example output from the program can be seen below
\begin{align*}
&\text{ 8 + 8 } \\
&\text{The result is 16} \\
\end{align*}
