\section{Assignment 5}
Sign extension is when you convert a number represented by fewer bits to a
number represented by more bits. for converting a $n$-bit number $N$ to a $m$-bit
number $M$, you place $N$ at the least significant end of $M$ and fill up the
rest of $M$ with the value of the $n^{th}$-bit of $N$.

Examples:
\begin{gather*}
0b001 \rightarrow 0b000001\\
0b1 \rightarrow 0b1111\\
0b1001 \rightarrow 0b111001\\
0b01001 \rightarrow 0b001001
\end{gather*}
(where $0x$ is used for hex-numbers, $0b$ is used for binary representation)
