\section{Assignment 4}
As described earlier when using $lb$ if the \emph{MSB} is set the number will be
taken as being negative, thus the rest 24-bits will be $1$'s (if the \emph{MSB}
is not set, they will be $0$'s). Using the \emph{lbu} operation allows for
loading of unsigned 8-bit bytes. thus the remaining 24-bits will be $0$'s no
matter what.
