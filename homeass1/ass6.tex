\section{Assignment 6}
The code for home assignment 2 can be seen in the listing below. It does not handle the danish æøå characters as
they have a troublesome position in the extended ascii table. The same method as is used to handle lowercase letters
below can, however, be used to handle these. The code tests whether the input is in the range of lowercase letters in
 the ascii table, if it is, it then subtracts \(0x20\) from the character code making it upper case.
