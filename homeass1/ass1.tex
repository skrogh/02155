\section{Assignment 1}
The source for assignment 1 can be found in listing \ref{lst:ass1}. Note that
$t3$ had to be used instead of $t2$ on line 29 as different results occurred on
different machines. Likewise the unconditional branch $b$ has been changed to a $j$ to compile without errors in \emph{windows XP}. Cause is unknown.
