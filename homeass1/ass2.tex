\section{Assignment 2}
"Typing" in numbers with the button we can add numbers:
\begin{align}
0x01 (1) + 0x01 (1) &\rightarrow 0x02 (2)\label{eq:per1}\\
0x01 (1) + 0xFF (-1) &\rightarrow 0x00 (0)\label{eq:per2}\\
0x01 (1) + 0x7F (127) &\rightarrow 0x80 (-128)\label{eq:per3}\\
0xFF (-1) + 0x80 (-128) &\rightarrow 0x7F (127)\label{eq:per4}
\end{align}
Points of interest are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
\eqref{eq:per2} where we add $0xFF$ and $0x01$ we have to note, that due to the use of $lb$ we are loading a signed byte and $0xFF$ will be $-128$ and not $255$.
\item
\eqref{eq:per3} When the sum of the two operands is greater than $127$ we will experience overflow, and
\item
\eqref{eq:per3} When the sum of the two operands is smaller than $-128$ we will experience overflow.
\end{itemize}
