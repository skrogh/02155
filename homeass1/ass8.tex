\section{Assignment 8 }
The modified code can be seen in the listing below. It is mostly the same with the only minor change being the
destination register of the addu operation, which has been changed to \$a1 such that the printf function can use it.
Furthermore a nullterminated ascii string is included in the data segment of the program and the address of this string
is loaded into the \$a0 register for use by printf.
