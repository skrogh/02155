\section{Assignment 7}
The program prints "hello, world" to the console and places the cursor at the beginning of a new line.
The different escape sequences given have the following functions as ascii codes
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\backslash\)t is the tab character with ascii code 0x09
\item \(\backslash\)n is the newline character which places the cursor on a newline, it has ascii code 0x0A
\item \(\backslash\)b is the backspace character, it deletes the previous character and moves the cursor back one character. It has
ascii code 0x08
\item \(\backslash\)" is the doublequote escape character with ascii code 0x22. This is not a control sequence as double quotes are 
a printable character, but the C compiler translates double quotes as string markers.
\item \(\backslash\)r is the carriage return control sequence, it's function is to return the cursor to the beginning of the 
current line, in mipsIt however, it does nothing. It has ascii code 0x0D.
\end{itemize}
